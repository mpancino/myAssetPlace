# Financial Projections Review Checklist

## Documentation Review
- [ ] Review PDD requirements for Phase 7: Financial Projections
- [ ] Compare against build checklist items related to projections
- [ ] Document key architectural components required by PDD
- [ ] Identify user stories and acceptance criteria

## Current Cashflow Implementation
- [ ] Review cashflow page implementation and component structure
- [ ] Verify regular income calculations (employment, investments, etc.)
- [ ] Verify regular expense calculations for all asset types
- [ ] Examine interest expense calculations for all loan types
  - [ ] Mortgages with property linkage
  - [ ] Standalone loans
  - [ ] Different payment frequencies
- [ ] Validate payment amount calculations
  - [ ] Automatic calculation based on term and rate
  - [ ] Manual entry support
- [ ] Assess cashflow summary visualization
- [ ] Verify net cashflow calculation

## Balance Sheet Implementation
- [ ] Review balance sheet page implementation
- [ ] Verify asset categorization and grouping
- [ ] Verify liability categorization and grouping
- [ ] Validate current valuation methods for each asset class
- [ ] Examine equity calculation methodology
- [ ] Assess balance sheet visualization components
- [ ] Verify growth rate application for assets

## Projection Configuration
- [ ] Examine projection time horizon settings
- [ ] Assess growth rate configuration options
- [ ] Verify inflation rate settings
- [ ] Review scenario creation and management
- [ ] Validate UI controls for user configuration

## Cashflow-to-Cash Account Configuration
- [ ] Review configuration interface for cashflow allocation
- [ ] Verify mechanism to add net cashflow to selected cash account
- [ ] Examine handling of cashflow when not allocated to cash account
- [ ] Test positive cashflow allocation
- [ ] Test negative cashflow allocation (cash account depletion)
- [ ] Validate fallback behavior when selected cash account is depleted
- [ ] Review visualization of allocated vs. unallocated cashflow in projections

## Projection Calculations
- [ ] Verify forward projection of asset values
  - [ ] Real estate appreciation
  - [ ] Investment growth
  - [ ] Cash account interest
  - [ ] Retirement account growth
- [ ] Verify forward projection of liabilities
  - [ ] Loan amortization
  - [ ] Interest expense reduction over time
- [ ] Examine handling of time-limited assets/income
  - [ ] Employment income to retirement age
  - [ ] Stock option vesting and expiry
- [ ] Validate income adjustments for inflation
- [ ] Validate expense adjustments for inflation
- [ ] Verify net worth calculation over projection period

## Projection Visualization
- [ ] Review chart implementation for projected net worth
- [ ] Verify tabular data display for projected values
- [ ] Assess asset allocation visualization over time
- [ ] Examine cashflow projection visualization
- [ ] Validate filtering options for projection view
- [ ] Test responsiveness of projection visualizations

## Architecture Review
- [ ] Evaluate separation of concerns in projection code
- [ ] Review shared calculation functions
- [ ] Assess data flow from current values to projected values
- [ ] Examine caching strategies for projection data
- [ ] Verify client/server responsibilities for calculations
- [ ] Review error handling in projection calculations

## Performance Assessment
- [ ] Test projection calculation performance with large asset counts
- [ ] Assess rendering performance of projection visualizations
